### OVERVIEW

COVID-19 is the illness responsible for the global pandemic that occurred in year 2020, causing the deaths of millions of people across the world. This illness caused by a novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome **Corona Virus 2** (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in Wuhan City, China.
Some infected persons experience mild to moderate respiratory illness, recovering without intensive medical attention, while others especially the elderly, with underlying medical conditions are more likely to develop serious illnesses that may lead to death.

In this project, I investigated and visualized a COVID-19 data collected from the World Health Organization using PowerBI software application. This provided several insights into the overview of the total Covid cases and other metrics. It also served as a tracker of the infection rate per country from 2020 to date.

The metrics examined are:
1. Active Cases
2. Infection Rate
3. Death Rate
4. Total number of Recovered Persons
5. Recovery Rate
6. Total number of serious cases
7. Total COVID Cases
8. Total number of deaths
9. Total Population
    
Before embarking on this project, I drafted the analysis workflow to foster a smooth data ride. This workflow include:
> Data Gathering: Direct Download

> Visual Data Accessing: Microsoft Excel

> Accessing Programmatically: Python

> Data Cleaning: Power Query

> Data Modeling: PowerBI

> Reporting - PowerBI

### INSIGHTS
1. A large number of positive COVID-19 cases are fully recovered and discharged. Many combative measures have been adopted by countries to mitigate the spread of this virus.
2. The country of Montenegro has the highest infection rate overall, with 25.09% of its population contracting the virus.
3. The USA has the overall highest number of cases, total deaths, total recovered, and serious cases recorded in the world, with India and Brazil following closely behind. This, as expected, is a result of the large population in these counties.
4. Countries like Macao, Palau, Marshall Islands, and more, with low cases have the highest recovery rate. It is easier and faster to curb a small number of infected cases, rather than a large population.
5. Yemen is the country with the highest death rate overall. It is known to be one of the poorest countries in Asia.
6. New cases of the COVID-19 virus have arisen in European countries like the UK, Russia, Germany, Poland, and the Netherlands.
7. The top 5 countries with the highest number of currently active cases are USA, UK, Russia, Germany, and Netherlands. This could be a result of population and the new cases arising in Europe. 
8. USA, India, UK, Russia, and France have the highest record of COVID-19 tests taken. This could be a result of either the high population of these countries or the high immigration rate.
9. South America has the highest death rate of 2.7%, followed by Africa with 2.6%. According to the Wall Street Journal, this is a result of the occurrence of more infectious variants, low vaccination rates, weak health care, and the nonchalant approach of the government to controlling the virus. Africa recorded a high death rate as a result of the low provision of high-quality health care.
10. Africa has the lowest infection rate of 0.66%. This is the result of factors like a large young population, a favorable climate, and quick mitigation action according to Global Development Commons.
11. The countries with the highest rate of infection per continent include Seychelles (Africa), Georgia (Asia), Fiji (Australia), Montenegro (Europe), French Guiana (South America), Aruba (North America). These are low gdp countries. 
12. Highest Overall cases per continent occurred in South Africa (Africa), India (Asia), Australia (Australia), UK (Europe), US (North America), Brazil (South America).
13. Counties with the highest death rate per continent are: Western Sahara (Africa), Yemen (Asia), Vanuatu (Australia), Bosnia and Herzegovina (Europe), Mexico (North America), Ecuador (South America). All these countries except Mexico have low gdp. According to the Global Development Commons, death toll was high because of the low testing rate. Citizens, however, believe it is a result of the slow response of the government.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
From the insights derived, It is glaring that the high spread of this virus is largely influenced by high population, government nonchalant approaches, poverty rate (low GDP), unfavourable climate, and occurrence of more infectious variants.

I recommend that:

1. Healthcare assistance be provided to low GDP countries.
2. More tests should be taken.
3. More vaccines should be produced and evenly distributed, especially to countries with low temperature weather.
4. Rapid response to covid-like symptoms.
5. Collaboration of the Government with the citizens on more sensitization on prevention and mitigation procedures.
